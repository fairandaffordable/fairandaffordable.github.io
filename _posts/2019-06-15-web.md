The **website of the Fair and Affordable Pricing Initiative has been launched** in December 2019, and it is under continuous development ever since. 
Apart from disseminational purposes, the website also serves as a platform to share publicly available information between cooperating countries. 
An example would be description of the submission / evaluation  procedure (for more details, see the [Mutual Cooperation](http://192.168.1.2:4000/mutual?target=_blank) page), or the the list of technologies submitted for reimbursement in each of the participating countries (see the [Data Sharing](http://192.168.1.2:4000/datasharing?target=_blank) page for more details).

The website uses open-source technologies in a very transparent manner - our [Github repository](https://github.com/fairandaffordable?target=_blank) has all the details available for you!
