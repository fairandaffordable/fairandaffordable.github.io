The countries participating in the Fair and Affordable Pricing initative held an information sharing workshop (with a product-specific focus) to facilitate voluntary cooperation on the critical assessment of medicinal products undergoing evaluation for reimbursement. During the workshop - initiated by Hungary - participants discussed the approach towards the identification, quantification, and interpretation of limitations of health economic evulations and shared their practices towards setting up a new base case for the appraisal process.

In order to identify assessments running in parallel, the data sources of undergoing projects were shared by the participating countries, and similar future events were suggested.
