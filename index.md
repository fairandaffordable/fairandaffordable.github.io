# Objective

This is the website of the Fair and Affordable Pricing Initiative (*FaAP* in short), a regional cooperation of European Countries aiming to **improve and facilitate access to effective and affordable medicinal products**.

## How it works

FaAP relies on the assumption that mutual cooperation can make the public reimbursement system more efficient. Therefore, this initiative develops methods and modalities of cooperation and negotiations. This translates to expert meetings of participants where information is exchanged to finally set up pilot negotiations with common positions on the modalities of pricing.

## Mandate & partners

The health ministers of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia signed the second Memorandum of Understanding on the 15th of May, 2019, serving as a framework for the collaboration. This mandate enables the participants to contribute voluntarily, create task groups and handle any practicalities to maintain the joint operations. Experts active in FaAP represent the ministries of health, financing agents and health technology assessment bodies of participating countries. 

The governance structure of FaAP can be illustrated as the following:

| *Role*       | *Member*               |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Strategic    | Ministries of Health   |
| Coordinative | Coordination Committee |
| Operative    | Working Groups         |

The chairman (Dominik DZIURDA, PL) and the vice-chairman (Neringa BERNOTIENE, LT) of the Coordination Committee serve as a point-of-contact for FaAP.
