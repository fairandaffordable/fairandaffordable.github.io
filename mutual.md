The local reimbursement application procedures in each of the partnering FaAP countries are introduced below.

### Czech Republic

### Hungary

The local reimbursement process is initiated by the (or the representative of the) market authorization holder. The reimbursement dossier is submitted to the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF). 
If the submission is eligible for a full procedure, the dossier is forwarded to he National Institute of Pharmacy and Nutrition (NIPN) for critical assessment, and 
the Board of Medical Professionals is invitited to provide a clinical opinion. 

These opinions are consolidated on the meetings of the Technology Assessment Committee, which provides advice to the NHIF on the proposal for decision. 
The final decision maker is the Ministry of Health (Ministry of Human Capacities), which modifies the appropriate laws & publishes it in the Official Gazette 
to reimburse the appropriate products (also specifying further details, such as list of providers or indication).

Neither the opinion of the Board of Medical Professionals or NIPN are legally binding for the NHIF or the MoH. 
Information on the pharmaceutical market is fairly detailed (product-level information on list prices and consumption Rx pharma products), yet mostly available in Hungarian. 
The database of available products with their reimbursement status is available [here](http://www.oep.hu/felso_menu/szakmai_oldalak/gyogyszer_segedeszkoz_gyogyfurdo_tamogatas/egeszsegugyi_vallalkozasoknak/pupha/Vegleges_PUPHA.html?target=_blank).
